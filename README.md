# Problem Statement:
AtliQ tried to enter the Latin America market but failed.

They made decisions only based on Excel surveys and gut feeling (intuition), not proper data.

They now face tough competition from Dale, who uses advanced data analysis.

AtliQ needs a better system to track business data and make smart decisions.

Collect and study customer and product data

Set KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to measure performance

Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to help AtliQ make smart business decisions

Build a 360° dashboard that covers: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Executive View

Use data to understand customer behavior and improve sales and marketing

Compete with Dale and increase market share
