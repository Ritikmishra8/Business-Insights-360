# Problem Statement:

● AtliQ tried to grow in Latin America but failed. They made decisions based only on Excel surveys and guesses.

● As the company grew fast, Excel became slow and not useful for complex decisions.

● They don’t have a strong data system, so they struggle to make fast and accurate choices.

● Their competitor, Dale, uses modern data analytics to understand customers and perform better.

# Objectives:

● Collect and analyze customer data and define KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

● Create a dashboard using Power BI to help AtliQ with clear and fast decisions.

● Build a 360° dashboard showing important insights from Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive View — all in one place.

● Use analytics to understand customer habits and improve products and marketing, helping AtliQ grow and compete with Dale.

# Key Insights:

1) Finance View
   
● Net sales increased every year, with peaks in November–December (holiday season).

● In March 2020, sales dropped due to COVID-19.

● By 2022, sales nearly hit the target (missed by just 1.5%).

● Net profit dropped slightly due to company expansion.

● Gross margin dropped in 2020 but recovered well by 2022, showing strong growth.

2) Sales View:
 
● Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Gross Margin stayed around 60:40 ratio.

● Amazon, AtliQ Exclusive, and e-Store had the highest sales.

● In 2022, Amazon and e-Store missed the Gross Margin % target.

● Some regions (like the Philippines, Germany, Brazil, etc.) performed below the 10% GM% target range.

3) Marketing View:

● Notebooks had the highest Net Sales in all years.

● Desktops weren't sold in 2019 but grew well in Net Profit % and GM% after.

● Networking products had the best Net Profit %.

● Keyboards and laptops were the most sold products.

4) Supply Chain View
   
● Accessories (especially keyboards) often went out of stock due to high demand.

● Desktops had too much stock, likely because laptops were selling more.

● November and December had the most net errors (stockouts or overstock).

● Forecast accuracy dropped during COVID-19 but improved by 2022.

5) Executive View 

● In 2022, PCs gave the highest revenue (61%), followed by Accessories (36%) and Networking & Storage (2.5%).

● Most revenue came from retailers (71%), then direct sales (18%), and distributors (10%).

● Amazon was the top customer, and laptop variants from the Desktop segment sold the most.

● Three regions gave 75% of total revenue: North America (27%), India (25%), and Rest of Asia (21%).

● AtliQ entered the market in 2020 and reached a 5.9% share by 2022, while Dale led with 22%.

● Year by year, sales and market share increased, but from 2021, net profit dropped a little.

# Recommendations

● Improve supply chain to reduce stockouts (Accessories) and overstock (Desktops).

● Focus on underperforming regions like Brazil, Germany, and Philippines with better pricing and promotions.

● Invest in better forecasting tools to handle peak months like November & December.

● Strengthen retail partnerships (since they bring 71% revenue), but also grow direct and distributor sales.

● Compete better with Dale by adding new features, better pricing, and strong marketing.

● Invest more in top-performing segments like Notebooks and Networking and expand high-demand products like laptops and accessories.
